<p>My favorite hooby is soccer and I absolutely love everything about it. 
    When Im talking to poeple about the sport, I explain to them how its like a huge
     constant game of chess with strategy and skill.I've been playing socce ever 
     since  was a young boy, playing in small leagues, highschool, and one year in 
     my community college. In addition, I beleive soccer also brings people together 
     by having people share a common thing.</p>
<p>I play soccer whenever I can especially at the field house with atleast 10 other 
    individuals. My favorite soccer team is Arsenal which makes me a gunner!.</p>
