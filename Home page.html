  <h3> HISTORY </h3>
     
     <p> I first began high school in Skokie at Niles North High School. After graduating, I began my college career at Oakton Comminuty college. I attended this college for four years, racking up about 100 credit hours before transfering to Northern Illinois University. At my community college, I realized I wanted to learn how businesses are run and what it takes for a company to run from A to Z. This led me to decide to major in operations management and information systems while also getting my minor in business analytics.</p>
<p></p>
<p> I am now 5 weeks away from graduating!</p>
